## Description
A "honeypot" webpage that is used to display a fake organisation that fingerprints the actor's device and browser information upon visit. Once an actor visits the page for login, fingerprint.js will be executed. This data will be logged for SIEM monitoring like Splunk and creating signatures. To lure attackers, credentials can be released on the net whereupon successful logon using those credentials would reveal bad actors and fingerprinting is done. Failed login attempts can also be monitored for fingerprinting when brute force takes place. Splunk rules for those scenarios can be created and once alerted it will execute main.py which is responsible for extracting the right fingerprints from the logs for generating 3 main types of signatures for each actor/unique fingerprint. These 3 signatures are designed for 3 different stages of defence - Rate Limiting, Challenge, Blocks which can be released to the cyber community to deal will the bad actors with continuously updating signatures.

## Websever Setup
Install the package & and run `install`
> Take note - if you have apache installed and happen to have any files in `/var/www/html`, you will have to tranfer them somewhere safe since this directory will be overwritten
```shell
git clone https://github.com/DJShankyShoe/yetToBeNamed.git
tar -xvzf yetToBeNamed.git && cd yetToBeNamed
sudo ./install
```

1. Upon successful/failed login, the page will load fingerprint.php
2. Login status gets logged and monitored by splunk
3. Fingerprint.php collects fingerprint from the actor's device and broswer
4. Fingerprint.php creates a randomly generated PHP file name for retrieving POST data
5. Fingerprint Data is POSTED to the generated PHP file
6. The generated PHP file, logs the fingerprint whoch would be monitored by splunk
7. The generated PHP file deletes itself after PHP is fully executed
8. Upon alert from SIEM Splunk (customizable by the user), it executes main.py 
9. Main.py extracts the appropriate fingerprint for that event
10. Main.py will finally generate 3 main types of Yara signatures where used for **Rate Limiting**, **Challenge**, **Block**

## After alert being triggered
The main.py located at ```/opt/splunk/bin/scripts``` will be executed</br>
The script will hash the JSON formated fingerprints and verifies for any duplicates in hash.txt

**If Duplicate Exist:**
- Do nothing

<br>**If NO Duplicates Exist:**
- Update the myhash.txt
- Create a new folder named: yara-(Hash values of the JSON fingerprintsï¼‰, in the folder it will consist:
  1. yara_ratelimit
  2. yara_challenge
  3. yara_block

## Splunk Dashboard
This is sample dashboard that user can use:

## Use Cases

Attackers have been using multiple methods to exploit sites, services, steal credentials & much more. When successful, attackers can use that to gain access to restricted sites, information or permissions. At this stage, defenders would be 1 step behind thus it is important to gain hold of attacker footprints in advance to improve defensive detection by introducing more specific signatures directed to those attackers/bad actors. 

### Scenario: Exposed Credentials
> Releasing fake credentials on such places will lure attackers to our site,  giving us information about their fingerprints.

`Release of our website credentials on pastebins`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62169971/150104029-e7cfb3ad-775f-4a50-9ad3-4c2ea24f1e40.png)
---
`When attacker's crawler picks it up, the attacker would attempt to log in using our credentials on our honeypot site`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62169971/150104616-2ac73027-093a-4c6b-8464-efa16cf1a070.png)
---
`Upon logon, fingerprinting of attacker's device is collected`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62169971/150104677-32082f31-387f-4e42-b611-e2def69ed436.png)
---
`A rule written to detect login will be triggered and execute a python script to create signatures`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62169971/150110059-de2ba7b0-1a66-48a3-ace3-40fa6260b7ec.png)
---
`3 main types of signatures are created (Block, Challenge, Rate Limit)`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62169971/150109026-53261c6d-7b8d-4c07-ac04-5a5498e026be.png)
---
`For this scenarios, the Block signature can be integrated with a firewall to block the attacker usage to organisation network` <br>
**Do note that, from the picture below, the attacker is blocked from accessing the honeypot site which is only an example. Organisation can use those signatures on their actual network to deal with attackers**

### Scenario: Bruteforce
> Reducing redirections & wait times after failed logins would increase the simplicity to perform bruteforce attacks

`When come across our honeypot site, attackers may attempt to perform bruteforce (when unsuccesful login occurs, fingerprinting of attacker's device is collected)`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62169971/150117223-8ada9e1c-25ba-4154-8849-51174fc80229.png)
---
`A rule written to detect bruteforce attempts will be triggered and execute a python script to create signatures`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62169971/150117272-71b0b165-ace3-44f0-9760-1c5799904d11.png)

`3 main types of signatures are created (Block, Challenge, Rate Limit)`

---
`For this scenarios, the Challenge signature can be used for creating recaptcha to prevent/slow down bruteforce attempts by attackers`
**Do note that, from the picture below, the attacker is challenges with recaptcha on the honeypot site which is only an example. Organisation can use those signatures on their actual network to deal with attackers**

## Why create signatures from browser fingerprints

### Reduce False Positives
Organisation has been mostly using only IP Addresses to deal with bad actors. Sometimes these information are not enough as these IP's could come from organisations, merchants, or any shared groups. These can largly affect customers when using single information like IP for blocks, challenges or rate-limiting. Thus to limit false positives, we can use broswer fingerprints to uniquely identify bad actors among actors for defensive measures without affecting customers and merchants. 

### Simplicity
It is very easy to obtain broswer fingerprints using javascript or logs. It can be done in the background without affecting cusotmer's experience. This makes it simple for organisation to deploy tools for broswer fingerprinting. 

### High Redundancy
Browser fingerprints can be broken down to other multiple information such as header, ip, hardware, canvas hash, etc. So even if 1 or more information is missing, a proper signature can still be crafted for various use cases and confidence levels.

## Moving Forward
- Using the created signature yara_block to create auto block
- Integration of more SIEM tools
- Fingeprint more information
- Customize your own signatures easily
