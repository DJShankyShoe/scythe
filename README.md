# yetToBeNamed

## Description
A "honeypot" webpage that is used to display a fake organisation that fingerprints the actor's device and browser information upon visit. Once an actor visits the page for login, fingerprint.js will be executed. This data will be logged for SIEM monitoring like Splunk and creating signatures. To lure attackers, credentials can be released on the net whereupon successful logon using those credentials would reveal bad actors and fingerprinting is done. Failed login attempts can also be monitored for fingerprinting when brute force takes place. Splunk rules for those scenarios can be created and once alerted it will execute main.py which is responsible for extracting the right fingerprints from the logs for generating 3 main types of signatures for each actor/unique fingerprint. These 3 signatures are designed for 3 different stages of defence - Rate Limiting, Challenge, Blocks which can be released to the cyber community to deal will the bad actors with continuously updating signatures.

## Websever Setup
Install the package & and run `install`
> Take note - if you have apache installed and happen to have any files in `/var/www/html`, you will have to tranfer them somewhere safe since this directory will be overwritten
```shell
git clone https://github.com/DJShankyShoe/yetToBeNamed.git
tar -xvzf yetToBeNamed.git && cd yetToBeNamed
sudo ./install
```

- Upon successful/failed login, the page will load fingerprint.php
- Fingerprint.php creates a randomly generated PHP file name for retrieving POST data
- Fingerprint.php collects fingerprint from the actor and POSTS it to the generated PHP file
- The generated PHP file logs the fingerprint & deletes itself
- The logs from apache & fingerprint is logged by SIEM Splunk
- Upon alert (customizable by the user), it executes main.py which then extracts the appropriate fingerprint for that event
- Main.py will then generate 3 main types of Yara signatures where used for **Rate Limiting**, **Challenge**, **Block**

## After alert being triggered
The main.py located at ```/opt/splunk/bin/scripts``` will be executed</br>
The script will hash the JSON formated fingerprints and verifies for any duplicates in hash.txt

**If Duplicate Exist:**
- Do nothing

<br>**If NO Duplicates Exist:**
- Update the myhash.txt
- Create a new folder named: yara-(Hash values of the JSON fingerprintsï¼‰, in the folder it will consist:
  1. yara_ratelimit
  2. yara_challenge
  3. yara_block

## Splunk Dashboard
This is sample dashboard that user can use:

Funtions of this dashboard
- The user able to select the hash to check the 3 Yara signatures
- The user able to input ip to check if there is realated hash to the IP
- Check the locations

## Use Cases
 
## Moving Forward
- Using the created signature yara_block to create auto block
- Integration of more SIEM tools
- Fingeprint more information
- Customize your own signatures easily
